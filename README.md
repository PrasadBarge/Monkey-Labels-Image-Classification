# Monkey-Labels-Image-Classification

The notebook appears to contain code, explanations, and outputs related to a deep learning project. It involves convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and likely focuses on data analysis or predictive modeling. To provide insights, I will extract key details from the notebook. Let me proceed with identifying the structure and main components. ​​

The notebook contains the following:

Markdown cells: 0 (no explanatory text is present in the notebook).
Code cells: 13 (these include the main code used for the analysis or modeling).
Outputs: 13 (results or visualizations from the executed code).
I'll analyze the code cells and outputs to generate key insights. ​​

Here are some initial insights from the notebook:

# Overview of Code
Libraries and Tools Used:

Core libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot for data manipulation and visualization.
Deep learning framework: TensorFlow and its keras module for building and training the CNN.
Other tools: ImageDataGenerator for image augmentation, and Scikit-learn utilities for data preprocessing and splitting.
Data Structure:

The dataset includes training and validation directories containing images, classified into 10 different classes, as seen in the train_dir and test_dir paths.
# Outputs and Data Observations
Dataset Overview:

The dataset contains 10 classes of primates, identified by labels, their Latin names, and common names.
Example classes include:
                       Mantled howler
                       Patas monkey
                       Bald uakari
The number of images per class varies, with approximately 130–150 images for training and 26–30 for validation.
Dataset Insights:

                Total images in training: 1,098 across all classes.
                The data is balanced with roughly equal representation across classes.
Preliminary Results:
                   The notebook mentions successful image categorization with 10 classes.


Would you like me to extract insights from specific sections, analyze modeling results, or provide detailed suggestions?
